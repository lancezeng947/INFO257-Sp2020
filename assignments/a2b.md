### Database Project Design (2 - 4 pages)

The following information should be decided and turned in for the preliminary design of your personal database project:
- A written description of the data you will be using for the database, and what uses you might expect the database to have. This should include information about the source of the data used, the purposes for which it will be used, any issues or requirements of the database, etc.
- A preliminary data dictionary for the entities and attributes and format of the data elements of the database. You should have at least 5 entities with some logical connections between them. 
The data dictionary consists of all of the attributes that you have identified for each entity, along with indication of whether the attribute is a primary key (or part of a primary key), and what format the data will be (e.g.: text, decimal number, integer, etc.)
- An entity-relationship diagram of the database OR a UML diagram.

These will be preliminary design specifications, so do not feel that you must follow everything that you describe here in the final database design.

Here are some project ideas from previous years:
- A database of meals and corresponding recipes that would make it easy to discover new meals to make for yourself\
- A database that contains public data about the availability and affordability of food in the bay area by aggregating and analyzing existing data
- A movie database that can answer very practical questions from the user, i.e. where could I legally watch movies who a particular actor is in
- A language database that aims to categorize which languages are spoken in which particular regions in the world
- A database of notable open source projects to discover insights on popular programming languages used, the contributors to open source, and the organizations that back these projects
